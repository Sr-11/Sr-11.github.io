== Some Big Problems

- Understanding and Building Smarter AI (or more specifically, maybe fundation models).  
- What is intelligence, how to define it?

- Why can't current AI learn how to do math (inherently, but not prompting LLM to write codes)?
- How does human realize how to do logics and reasoning?

== Chatting
I am enthusiastic about learning from and working with people of various backgrounds. If there's something interest to discuss, I would appreciate hearing from you.
