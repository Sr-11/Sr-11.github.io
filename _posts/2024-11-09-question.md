# List of Questions

I plan to maintain a list of fascinating questions that I wonâ€™t pursue in the short term (or possibly ever in my career) because they are too big and suicide to spend time thinking about. However, I am eager to know the answers in my lifetime.

## Physics

- The measurement problem.

## Cognitive

- What is consciousness.
- What structure in our brain enables abstract thinking? It's strange that we are in a continous physics world, and the neural network is continuous, but we can think discretely. 

When can we say we understand consciousness? Once we build up computer programs that have consciousness.

## Artificial Intelligence

- Theoretical foundations of AI.
- How can a ML algorithm learn to reason? 
- Theory to explain things cannot be explained by traditional learning theory.
