Determinism posits that all events, including human actions, are ultimately determined by prior causes. In a deterministic universe, everything that occurs is the inevitable result of preceding states and conditions. This view of a predictable universe is a natural implication of classical Newtonian physics, which describes a world in which objects and systems follow precisely determined paths. Such a perspective challenges the idea of libertarian free will, suggesting it may be "just an illusion."

However, a common objection to determinism is that quantum physics introduces fundamental randomness into the universe. Many argue that because quantum mechanics involves probabilistic outcomes, our universe cannot be deterministic. But is this claim accurate?

In a closed system, the quantum state evolves predictably according to the Schrödinger equation:

$$
\psi_t = e^{iHt}\psi_0
$$

where the evolution of the state $$\psi$$ depends on the initial conditions and the Hamiltonian $$H$$. This predictable evolution implies that, at a fundamental level, quantum mechanics is deterministic within a closed system.

## Understanding Randomness

### Classical Randomness

In classical mechanics, randomness often arises from incomplete information or chaotic systems, not from inherent indeterminacy. Classical randomness is typically due to the limitations in our knowledge about a system's initial state rather than any fundamental randomness in the laws themselves.

### Quantum Randomness

Quantum mechanics, however, is often seen as introducing intrinsic randomness, especially when measurements are involved. Yet, the Schrödinger equation governing the evolution of a quantum state is fully deterministic. The apparent randomness arises only when we make measurements, a process still not fully understood.

## What Makes Quantum Measurements Seem Random: A Simple Model

Quantum measurements yield probabilistic outcomes, but the process is governed by the wavefunction $$\psi$$, which evolves deterministically. This leads to the question: why do measurements yield random outcomes despite the underlying deterministic evolution?

## Can We Perform Exact Measurements?

Even if there is a fundamental wavefunction $$\psi$$ underlying our universe, it is not possible to measure it with perfect accuracy. Einstein’s famous phrase, "God does not play dice," reflects his belief in an underlying order and determinism. Quantum evolution may indeed be deterministic, but the **no-cloning theorem** suggests that only this “God” (or the universe itself) truly knows $$\psi$$. Humans, by contrast, will never have a means to measure $$\psi$$ precisely.

Thus:

>$$\textit{Quantum physics is not inherently random.}$$

It is important to note that this does not contradicts with Bell's inequality. Bell's inequality is assuming that quantum state still lies in clasical space, say $$\{\pm1\}$$ for a spin. But here, we are indeed working in Hilbert space, and a spin possesses a complex vector in $$\mathbb{C}^2.$$

## No-Cloning Theorem

**Theorem 1** [No-cloning Theorem]: For any fixed initial state of a "cloning machine" $$|A\rangle_C$$, there is no unitary operator $$U$$ such that
$$
U |\psi\rangle_A |0\rangle_B |A\rangle_C = |\psi\rangle_A |\psi\rangle_B |A'_\psi\rangle_C, \quad \forall |\psi\rangle.
$$

There are papers prove the possibility of classical cloning, see {% cite JohnBaez %}.  Theorem 1 suggests that there is no way to accurately measure a quantum state, even if we damage the original state, otherwise given its accurate value we can prepare two copies of it from another process, and assign them to A and B, respestively.


## Why Does This Seem So Strange?

It may feel counterintuitive to believe that $$\psi$$ objectively exists and evolves deterministically, yet we lack any means to measure it precisely. This disconnect between objective determinism and subjective randomness is a unique feature of quantum mechanics. 

Randomness is a very good model for quantum physics, because given no information of the environment, a random model give perfect prediction on the behavior of a quantum system. For example, although performing a macroscopic measurement make a quantum state collapse to an eigenstate, and which state will it collapse to is determinaitically determined by the environment, a random outcome servers as a good enough model, until the day that human are able to play the game like god, and know exactly the state of the environment. However, that would also be  impossible due to non-cloning. 

Since we never knows the exact state, does it suggests an redundancy of degree of freedom? Apperently maybe not. 

Also rethink why we think measurening x and p as natrual measurement, purely because we get used to them in the classical world. In the quantum world, it might not be appropreate to talk about  measuring x and p, because the measureent device itself is a macroscopic thing. 


## When is measuring possible.

Of course measurment is possible assuming
> $$\textit{Assumption 1: We can obtain a large amount of copies of the same quantum state.}$$

Then we perform sufficiently enough collapsing results to recover the state. Usually we may not need to recover the entire state, but just some projection of it. This Assumption 1, together with modeling the environment being at a "random state" (mixed state), we can obtain the QM axoim that $$\textit{measurement gives a random eigenstate}$$. The "env"-"sys" is a Markov chain.
